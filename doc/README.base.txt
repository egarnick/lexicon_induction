The full process of producing and scoring translation hypotheses requires the
following 6 steps.  Each step has a corresponding README file in

/g/ssli/data/lorelei/Software/Morfessor/baseline/doc/detail

Steps and README files
1.  Prepare the seed lexicon
  README.base.lex.txt
2.  Create word counts
  README.base.uzb_counts.txt
3.  Create word vectors
  README.base.uzb_vectors.txt
4.  Prepare the test items
  README.extract_test.tst
5.  Compare Uzbek and English word vectors to produce translation hypotheses
  README.base.compare_vectors.txt
6.  Score translations
  README.score_trans.txt

All resources necessary to create expanded translation hypotheses are in:

/g/ssli/data/lorelei/Software/Morfessor/glove/

This includes the README file for the GloVe expansion in ...glove/doc/detail
